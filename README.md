# critter_PLUS
CSE 4400 Project
This is a continuation of a project originally done for Game Programming in Spring of 2024. It is virtual pet sim where the goal is to raise the affection of your pet by interacting with it. It plays similar to cookie clicker where the cap to increase affection increases exponentially. As you progress, new ways to interact with critter appear. critter+ builds off of the foundation of the first iteration of the game, and substantial additions have been added to flesh out the experience including: a currency system, save system, cosmetics, and a minigame.

critter+ Development Team: James Conger, Eric Coria, Jorge Galicia-Romo, Autumn Gamache, Marlon Jimenez, and Dakota Rivera

Original Contributors for old critter: James Conger, Eric Coria, Hector Jimenez-Magadan, Marlon Jimenez, and Pedro Negron
